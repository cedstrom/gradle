Cache classloaders to improve daemon's performance and memory consumption

# Use cases

- User facilitates the daemon more frequently without the need for restarting it.
    Classloaders caching improves daemon footprint and avoids memory leaks.
- User observes faster builds:
    - less memory used, less gc is needed, faster build
    - each consecutive build is faster thanks to jvm hotspot optimisations. This is possible because classes are reused.

# Implementation notes

- in Gradle codebase we avoid direct creation of ClassLoaders (new URLCLassloader()) and we use a service
    that can manage caching and decide whether to reuse or create new CL.
- classloaders need to be cached based on the classpath and the parent classloader; classpath of the classloader cache key needs to consider file hashes
- should classloaders caching consider the 'kind' of the classloader?
    Do we have a case that 2 classloaders have the same classpath and parent and we explicitly
- we probably need to avoid mutation of the classloaders. Instead, new classloader can be created based on an existing one, and the creation managed through a service.
- how do we roll out this change incrementally? It is a breaking change. Do we offer an opt-in for this feature?

### Test coverage

- Given multiple projects in the build, verify that ClassLoaders are reused when nothing changes and are rebuilt of
the following changes:
    - build script is modified.
    - a parent build script is modified.
    - buildSrc classes are modified.
    - plugins applied by build script are modified.
    - plugins applied by a parent project are modified.
    - classpath declared in build script is modified.
    - classpath declared in parent project build script is modified.
    - an entry in the build script classpath that did not exist now does exist.
    - an entry in the build script classpath that did exist no longer does
    - a directory in the build script classpath is modified.
    - a jar in the build script classpath is modified.
    - a directory in the build script classpath is replaced with a jar, and vice versa.
- Verify that ClassLoaders *are* reused for the following changes:
    - a settings script or init script are modified.
    - a change is made to the build script that does not affect the generated byte code (eg change a comment).
- Performance test that demonstrates that execution is faster than previous releases.
